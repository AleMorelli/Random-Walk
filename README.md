# Random-Walk in two dimensions
Code for random walk statistical problem in 2D.

Supose that you have a drunk walker, a walker thet didn't know in wich direction (left or right) is goin to take the next step. 
The program is based in a simple plot, for every step taken a random number, between 0 and 1, is generated if the number is higher than 0.5,
the program return 1 (step to the right), and if the number is lower than 0.5 the program returns -1 (step to the left). 
Whit every iteration, a step is plotted into a cartesian graph, showing the path followed by the random walker.
